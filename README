If you read this, I was just gonna say that i am shutting this project down, you are allowed to use my source as you wish just that you credit me for it.
I may gonna do a remake since i have now got alot more better to design and code. If you know anybody that does use this project as some source and haven't read this.
Then please tell them from me that they have to read this before using my source.

UPDATE 12-04-2019: I created a demo/just a design over a 2.0 version. However it got corrupted so now i am remaking it. I am gonna go on vacation tommorow at 1 pm (Central EU Time)
So i wont be able to complete it until next week and maybe more days since i also have school next week.
